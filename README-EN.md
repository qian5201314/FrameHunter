[ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆæœ¬](README.md)

**FrameHunter** is a Chrome extension designed to extract all iframe URLs from the current page and provide convenient options to open or copy them.

---

## Features

- **Extract iframe URLs**: Quickly scan the current page and retrieve the `src` attributes of all iframes.
- **Detect empty `src`**: For iframes with no `src`, a message will display: `Current iframe src is empty`.
- **One-click actions**:
    - **Open**: Open the URL in a new tab.
    - **Copy**: Copy the URL to the clipboard.
- **Modern design**: A clean, user-friendly interface with automatic line breaks for long URLs and a fixed-width window for consistency.
- **User-friendly messaging**: If no iframes are found on the page, the plugin will display: `No iframes found on this page.`
